Explain the Ralph Wiggum technique and available commands:

**Ralph Wiggum** is an iterative loop technique for complex problem solving:
- `/ralph-loop` - Start a new loop for iterative refinement
- `/cancel-ralph` - Cancel the active loop
- The loop continues until the completion promise is fulfilled

This technique helps break down complex tasks into iterative improvements.
