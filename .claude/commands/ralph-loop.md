description: Start Ralph Wiggum loop for iterative problem solving
---

Use the ralph-wiggum agent to start an iterative loop for complex problem solving:

1. Enter the Ralph Wiggum loop mode for the current task
2. The loop continues until the completion promise is fulfilled
3. Each iteration refines the approach based on feedback

This is useful for complex tasks that require multiple iterations.
