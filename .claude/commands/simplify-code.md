description: Simplify and refactor code while preserving business logic
---

Use the code-simplifier agent to refactor and simplify code:

1. Analyze the code that needs simplification
2. Identify opportunities for:
   - Reducing code complexity
   - Eliminating duplication
   - Improving readability
   - Simplifying conditional logic
3. Apply refactoring while ensuring:
   - Business logic remains intact
   - No functional changes are introduced
   - Type safety is preserved
4. Output the simplified code with explanation of changes

If the user specifies specific files or code sections, focus on those areas. Otherwise, analyze the context and identify the most impactful areas for simplification.
